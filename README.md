# ACME-Dynamic_Website
The purpose was to create a dynamic website using HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL, <br> 
using the MVC(Model, View, Controller) principles. <br>
While reading and learning about PHP and SQL I was also building the website. <br>
It was a new experience because I didn't have much experience programming, <br>
just few simple projects but nothing about backend development.

I was helped by my team (Patricia and Daryl Payne) and of course by my instructor, <br>
they provided feedback along the way. We work on this around 12 weeks. <br>
